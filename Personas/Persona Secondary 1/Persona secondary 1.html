				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p>Ionescu Ana is a cashier at a local supermarket in Iasi, Romania. All she ever wanted was to create art, but the life hit her once she finished highschool and realized that art can't pay her for bills and food, which led to her current job.</p> 
				<p>She is a creative person with a lot of ideas and many designs in mind for almost everything. She lives alone and she spends most of her time on the internet since she doesn't have much friends. She always notices the design of web pages and think of better ones and what she would've done different.</p> 
				<p>Since a cashier is not a dream job for anyone, she aspires to get a better job, one that would feed her creativity and let her use it more. Her social skills aren't the best, which stopped her from trying to go to a Computer Science faculty. She is a shy person and more of a "less talk more facts" type of person.</p>
				<p>As she is still in her 20's she knows how to surface the web and work with different programs. As she loves good looking and aesthetic websites, she made her mind to learn how to create them on her own, in order to make a living out of it and spread her ideas around the world.</p>

			<h5>Scenarios</h5>
			<p><strong>Ana wakes up in her free day with a cup of coffee in her hand and ready to learn</strong></p>
			<p>She opens up her laptop and access the website application. She is already logged in, as she used the website in the past. She selects the next level or the next "game" and starts it. As she is having fun learning and solving games, after not long she finishes it and gets a perfect score.</p>
