				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p>Ion is a 21 year old college student from Iasi, Romania. He is just like any other student, willing to learn more and cultivate his mind with new technologies and information.</p>
				<p>Ion is very passionate towards his learning domain and wants to expand his knowledge, but he is not willing to put in the work reading books and studies, or when he does, sometimes he likes to take a break and relax whilst learning new stuff.</p>
				<p>He enjoys open enviroments where people are more connected when it comes to learning, feedback or interactivity is his top-priority, he is by nature a competitive person, he enjoys a little challenge when presented with one, and likes to test himself against all odds.</p>
				<p>In his free time, he likes to kill time playing games or being active on social sites, either on his phone or computer; connectivity through the internet is extremely important when it comes to his routine, so he did overtime gain an interest towards Web technologies.</p>
