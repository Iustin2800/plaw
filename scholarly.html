		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			In this document we will present a multi-user education game for learning in a fun way important concepts
			regarding Web technologies.
		</p>
		<p>
			This has a purely academic purpose.
			This document:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>contains a list of relevant sketches, wireframes, storyboards and interactive UI prototypes designed for
				Web and Mobile </li>
			<li>discusses the usability of interaction types/paradigms</li>
			<li>provides a number of personas that suits our application</li>
			<li>considers how interaction design patterns and used in the presentation of wireframes/prototypes.</li>
			<li>discusses the user flows and affective factors and emotions.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Old fashioned ways of teach are no longer as effective as they used to be, new generations are more
			willingly to have fun rather than study and they lose interest much faster than generations before. In order
			to keep them focused and in schools, teachers had to meet them half-way and change their teaching style to
			somewhat more fun. As every problem has at least a solution, people came up with applications that are using
			games a way to deliver information and teach.

	<section id="name_logo">
		<h2>Name and logo</h2>
		<p>"Plaw" represents the abbreviation of the application's name "Playing the Web". The logo achieves a distinct
			and memorable identity that sets it apart from other names. The use of abbrevations also facillitates
			effortless communication among users, making it users for them to refer to the app in the conversations with
			one another. </p>
		<p>Talking about the logo itself, it is a globe with a graduate hat, represents the main reason of our
			application, which is to facilitate educational activities. This symbol also signifies application's focus
			on teaching web techonlogies beside the commitment to providing a platform for learning.</p>
	</section>


	<section id="color_scheme">
		<h2>Color scheme</h2>
		<p>The color scheme mainly formed of the main turqoise color, is easy to the eye and very welcoming, it's also
			kind of a fun color, representing the fun aspect of the learning through games; there are also other
			complementing colors, which are bright and diverge focus on something important/needed.</p>
	</section>


	<section id="typography">
		<h2>Typography</h2>
		<p>The font (Hind) is a simple and basic one, it's not an out of the ordinary font as to not sacrifice
			readability; after all, the app's purpose is to teach users through games, and text is very important in the
			learning part</p>
	</section>
	</section>

	<section id="emotions">
		<h2>Affective factors and emotions</h2>
		<p>We want to promote our application as a way of learning while having fun, so you won't feel like putting much
			effort into acquiring that information. On the other way, we want our users to feel challenged mentally and
			in order to do so we added a level of competition by letting you race against other players.</p>
		<p>Since we know how learning process can be and we do no want our users to lose their interest, we developped a
			"Featured" menu where you can see the popular games, new games and most liked games.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="interaction_design_patterns">
		<h2>Interaction design patterns</h2>
		<section id="web_idp">
			<h3>Web</h3>
			<p>The homepage of the application has a simple navigation with no menus. The layout grid is card type,
				within there are information regarding the content of the website. </p>

			<p>Once logged into our account we can see that the content is following a split type layout grid: in the
				left part we have games, information about your account and rankings; in the right part there is the
				social part where you can find all your friends and groups. Once again the left layout is split
				in two parts, each part being aligned.(left to the left and right to the right) All buttons are hiding
				behind actions that can be triggered by left clicking. Also every person/group you see in the social
				part can be interacted with by left clicking which will open a chat.</p>

			<p>As you can see, we are using card layout to keep information short and concrete, so our users would not
				lose interest while browsing our page. In the "games" card and "ranking" card we used an expandable list
				which expands the list of the games/players you see until you've reached the end of that list </p>

			<p>Selecting a game will open up a new page with a similar layout as before. On the left we have a card with
				informations useful while playing the game and on the right we have the game in the top and a console in
				the bottom. Here we have a form pattern for input text. </p>
		</section>

		<section id="mobile_idp">
			<h3>Mobile</h3>
			<p>The bottom bar represents the navigation menu and is formed of icon buttons representing different tabs, there 
				is also a floating setting button at the top right of the app, always there no matter when someone switches 
				a tab or scrolls up and down. </p>
			
			<p>The layout is kept simple, everything is organized in a scrollable list with many items of different sizes placed 
				within, from which the user can interact with. </p>
			
			<p>There also is an intuitive tab switching feature using simple left and right swipes, there are also buttons to access 
				those tabs for people who can't or don't want to swipe, everything else consists of buttons that require simple taps 
				for simplicity. </p>

	<section id="user_flows">
		<h2>User flows</h2>
		<section id="web_uf">
			<h3>Web</h3>
			<img src="./Userflows/web_userflow.jpg" alt="web_flow">
			
		</section>

		<section id="mobile_uf">
			<h3>Mobile</h3>
			<img src="./Userflows/mobile_userflow.png" alt="mobile_flow">

	</section>

	<section id="interaction_type_paradigms">
		<h2>Interaction types/paradigms</h2>
		<p>One of them would be traditional interaction which seems to be the most common interaction type among our
			users. Our application being on a website it would be easier for anyone to use a mouse and keyboard in order
			to use our aplication because we have few buttons to interact with and many activities that include text
			input from users.</p>
		<p>However, it doesn't mean there is no space for others interaction types like haptic interactions. As we are
			also developping our application on mobile, we can use vibrations as feedback for wrong or incomplete
			answers to the courses. We can also have a resistance sensation to indicate that a puzzle piece won't fit in
			the place our user intended to place it, or it can be used for the end of the game to indicate that the game
			is over and any other interactions will not be effective.</p>
		<p>As we are talking about mobiles, there is also room for gestural interaction such as swiping through menus or
			courses which can help navigation by a lot. Combing gestural and haptic interactions in order to give the
			best feedback to our mobile users. For example: a tutorial will let user interact with a certain object and
			he would be asked to move it in order to fit somewhere. The user will have a little display with the code of
			that object.If our user doesn't manage to do the task, he would get slight vibrations to indicate that is
			wrong and for every wrong move the object will be slightly resistance to simulate the sensation of touching.
			If he does manage to do it, he will see the code modified. </p>
		<p>When it comes to the next type of interaction it doesn't matter if it is web or mobile application because
			social interaction is cross-platform. You can find new friends, have a little chat and also create groups
			where you can add your entire social group.</p>
