Next we will talk about interaction type/paradigms.

One of them would be traditional interaction which seems to be the most common interaction type among our users. Our application being on a website it would be easier for anyone to use a mouse and keyboard in order to use our aplication because we have few buttons to interact with and many activities that include text input from users.
However, it doesn't mean there is no space for others interaction types like haptic interactions. As we are also developping our application on mobile, we can use vibrations as feedback for wrong or incomplete answers to the courses. We can also have a resistance sensation to indicate that a puzzle piece won't fit in the place our user intended to place it, or it can be used for the end of the game to indicate that the game is over and any other interactions will not be effective.
As we are talking about mobiles, there is also room for gestural interaction such as swiping through menus or courses which can help navigation by a lot. Combing gestural and haptic interactions in order to give the best feedback to our mobile users. 
For example: a tutorial will let user interact with a certain object and he would be asked to move it in order to fit somewhere. The user will have a little display with the code of that object.If our user doesn't manage to do the task, he would get slight vibrations to indicate that is wrong and for every wrong move the object will be slightly resistance to simulate the sensation of touching. If he does manage to do it, he will see the code modified. 

When it comes to the next type of interaction it doesn't matter if it is web or mobile application because social interaction is cross-platform. You can find new friends, have a little chat and also create groups where you can add your entire social group.
